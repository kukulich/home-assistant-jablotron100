# Jablotron 100+

Home Assistant custom component for JABLOTRON 100+ alarm system.

Tested with JA-100K, JA-101K, JA-101K-LAN, JA-103K, JA-103KRY, JA-106K-3G, JA-107K.


## Features

### Sections

- States are reported to Home Assistant.
- You can arm/disarm all sections. Supported states are `arm_away` (= armed) and `arm_night` (= armed partially).
- Event `jablotron100_wrong_code` is triggered when wrong code is inserted in Home Assistant.
- Problem in a section is reported in specific "problem" sensor.

### Devices

- Devices with two states (on/off, active/inactive, open/closed etc.) are supported.
- Sabotage or problem of the device is supported in specific "problem" sensor.
- Temperature is reported for thermostats, thermometers and smoke detectors.
- Pulses are reported for electricity meters with pulse output.
- Signal strength is reported for wireless devices.
- Battery level is reported for devices with battery.

### PG outputs

- States are reported to Home Assistant.
- It's possible to turn on/off all PG outputs.

### Central unit

- State of LAN connection is reported to Home Assistant for supported central units.
- Strength of GSM signal is reported for supported central units.


## Before installation

1. Connect the USB cable to Jablotron central unit
2. Restart the Home Assistant OS
3. Use the following command line to identify the port:

    ```
    $ dmesg | grep usb
    $ dmesg | grep hid
    ```

    The cable should be connected as `/dev/hidraw[x]`, `/dev/ttyUSB0` or similar.


## Installation

- If you use code with a prefix, insert the code with the asterisk, e.g. `12*3456`.
- Use code of administrator to make devices work. If you cannot use code of administrator, or you don't want to use devices, set the number of devices to 0.
- You have to set devices in the same order as you see them in your J-Link/F-Link/mobile application. Ignore the central unit on position 0.
- If you want to use PG outputs, the user of the code has to have rights to control the PG outputs. Set the number of PG outputs to 0 to ignore them.

### HACS

1. Install the integration via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store)  
    <small>*HACS is a third party community store and is not included in Home Assistant out of the box.*</small>
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Jablotron integration should be available in the integrations UI

### Manual

1. [Download integration](https://github.com/kukulich/home-assistant-jablotron100/releases/)
2. Copy the folder `custom_components/jablotron100` from the zip to your config directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Jablotron integration should be available in the integrations UI


## Check

1. Try to arm/disarm all sections
2. Try to activate all devices if possible (open/close door/window, move ahead of motion sensor etc.) and check if Home Assistant see the state changes
3. Check log - it should be empty when everything works
4. Does any problem occur? Report [issue](https://github.com/kukulich/home-assistant-jablotron100/issues) or join [Discord](https://discord.gg/bNmaB6n)

Even if everything works for you, you can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/bNmaB6n).
We would be happy:
 - If you report model of you Jablotron central unit, so we know that integration works on another model
 - If you can test some things (e.g. LAN), so we can make the integration more robust

The communication in Discord is mostly in Czech or Slovak but don't be afraid - you can use English as well.


## Debugging
1. Enable debug logging for the Jablotron intergation via the [logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/) integration by adding the following lines to the `configuration.yaml` file.
```
logger:
  default: info
  logs: 
    custom_components.jablotron100: debug
```

2. Enable debug logging in the Jablotron integration. Go to the Integration page of your Home Assistant and click on the `Configure` button belonging to the Jablotron integration. Without changing any of the options, press the `Send` button. Afterwards, a second pop-up window opens: leave that too without any change and click on the `Send` button again. In the third pop-up window, enable the debugging by checking the `Enable debugging` checkbox and submit the configuration by pressing the `Send` button. Final, fourth pop-up window allows one to specify specific debugging options, such as `Log all incoming packets`. Finish the configuration by pressing the `Send` button.
3. After enabling 1. and 2., the home assistant log should contain debug log of the Jablotron integration, e.g.,
```
2022-02-17 10:57:19 DEBUG (ThreadPoolExecutor-2_0) [custom_components.jablotron100] Incoming: 801a0cffffffff010001002820010027ffffffffffffffffffffffff
2022-02-17 10:57:19 DEBUG (ThreadPoolExecutor-2_0) [custom_components.jablotron100] Incoming: 5203820113
```
